 I am currently a rising senior at SOS herman geminer school.Initially I wasnt't at SOS;
 I was a student at bahirdar acadamy from the years 1999-2003 E.C.Fortunatly;I was lucky enough
 to pass the entrance exam and was admitted to SOS;as stated I have been learning at SOS since grade 2.
I also plan of finishing my highschool years in this school.
<br><hr><br>
personally I don't believe that eduction is just formal education.And with that being said i would like 
so say a bit about other educations I have recived.I can play the piano with about 50 % efficency.
I am self thought on speaking spaninsh.I also took enterpureship and programining classes.
keep in mind that I am not an expert but i know my way around things.
<br><hr><br>
Eventhough I am just 18 and I havent seen the fraction of there is to see about life,
I believe that life is also a teacher and I can say I have learned my fair share in my years.
And I know that there is still a huge step to take I guess we will see in the years too come.
